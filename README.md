This project was in collaboration with Jaeyoon Wang as part of our Machine Learning Under an 
Optimization Lens course (an MIT speciality). This was our final project, where we tried to take some of
theoretical aspects of the course and apply them to real-world problems (in this case, customer churn). 
We compared more "robust" methods with classical machine learning methods (logistic regression, K-means
clustering). This involved exploring theory from outside the classroom, including robust K-means and its 
implications.
